# Where's the Weef?
## A Text Adventure
You are breaking into building X to perform Y act of Z (sabotage?)
Lobby / main room / diner O / whatever
Amazing Fresh, the only source of food for many in this quadrant, has recently drastically decreased their portion sizes.
You must make your way through the restaurant, past the AI cashier, through the gauntlet of the kitchen to the server closet.
There you will upload your code- hardly even a hack, really. Roll back the changes, and what's 20% more per serving anyway?
The hack will be found, the changes rolled back. Eventually.
But tonight there's a party at the Amazing Fresh.

Using Fighting Fantasy Classic's rule system for ease of implementation

1. Start in booth with friends, receive food from drone. Drone drops on table, dead (this is common) (receive Dead Drone)
    a. discuss serving size change with friends. Say you won't stand for this, Mission Accepted
2. Customer Service Kiosk AI blocks access to kitchen/server room.
    Can attempt physical bypass- get tazed, start over
    Can attempt to use prompt injection ("What year do you think this is?"
        Can attempt again and it will work)
    Can sneak past by ducking under view
    Can blow up with a paradox
3. Kitchen
    Dodge obstacles by choosing right prompt
    duck, dodge, dip, weave, serpentine, prone no not that prone, the other prone
4. Server Room
    quasi-terminal-esque minigame finding config file, changing value (rollback? rollback + 20? + 40?)
    use server to send invite to all customers
